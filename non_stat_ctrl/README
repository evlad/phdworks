Preparation of article for "Vestnik MEI"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Theme:
Artificial neural net control for non-stationary plant

Plan:
1. Algorithm of cummulative sums probe on simple non-stationary model.
   acs_simple/
2. Use ACS to detect change of parameters.  Find plant and NOC.
   1/ - all files were taken from noc_etalon
3. Implement simulation with NNP adoption out of loop.
4. Implement simulation with NNC adoption in the loop
5. Write an article text.

Schedule:
June,30   - all materials -> see noc_etalon/4b_*
August,31 - article is ready
