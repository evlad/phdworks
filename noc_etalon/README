Directories:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
0ev - evaluation (test) data set preparation
0tr - training data set preparation
1   - NNP training
1a  - NNP evaluation when plant becomes changed
      at t=500 from plant1.tf to plant2.tf
1b  - NNP evaluation when plant becomes changed
      at t=500 from plant1.tf to plant3.tf (plant_notst3.cof)
    * script split_tr_ev.sh makes 1b_0tr/*.dat and 1b_0ev/*.dat
1b_0ev   - evaluation data after plant change
1b_0tr   - training data after plant change
1b_1     - secondary NNP training to fit plant3.tf based on previous NNP
1b_1test - test for new NNP in loop
1b_3     - NNC in-the-loop training with new NNP
2   - NNC out-of-loop training
3   - NNC in-the-loop training
4   - NOC evaluation in the loop
4a  - NNP and NNC evaluation when plant becomes changed
      at t=500 from plant1.tf to plant2.tf
4b  - NNP evaluation when plant becomes changed
      at t=500 from plant1.tf to plant2.tf (plant_notst.cof)
    * script split_tr_ev.sh makes 4b_0tr/*.dat and 4b_0ev/*.dat
4b_0ev   - evaluation data after plant change
4b_0tr   - training data after plant change
4b_1     - secondary NNP training to fit plant2.tf based on previous NNP
4b_3     - secondary NNC in-the-loop training with plant2.tf and new NNP
4b_4     - new NOC evaluation in the loop and comparison with old one
4b_4old  - old NOC evaluation on series from 4b_4 in the loop
4c  - experimental search for CUSUM parameters
4c_1     - search for average time of false alarm
4c_2     - search for average time of alarm delay
5a  - NOC not adaptive behavior when plant becomes changed (at t=500)
5b  - NOC adaptive behavior when plant becomes changed (at t=500)
5d  - NOC+NNP adaptive behavior when plant becomes changed (at t=500)
6   - NNP adopted for changes (taken from 5a)
7   - NNP adopted in-the-loop for plant2 separately
8a  - influence of tau ascent on control MSE in non-adaptive NOC
8b  - influence of tau descent on control MSE in non-adaptive NOC
8c  - influence of gain ascent on control MSE in non-adaptive NOC
8d  - influence of gain descent on control MSE in non-adaptive NOC
8abcd - report graphs composition for 8a,b,c,d
9   - test for nnc_mode=tradcontr
9a  - test for nnc_mode=tradcontr on repeated the same r,n series
